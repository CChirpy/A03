Assignment 3 in my web development class, should just be a readme file explaining Git.

Today we are going to talk version control on <b>GitHub</b>.  We will go over <b>Git</b>, <b>GitHub</b>, and how to set up your IDE (In this case, JetBrains Webstorm) to use version control via <b>Git</b>.

Lets go over <b>Git</b>.
<b>Git</b> is an open source project that is made for version control.  What is version control?  Simply put, if I make a change on one device, all the other devices get an update.  For instance, I'm working on the code for a brand new website.  I would like to keep my work documented and backed up.  This is how <b>Git</b> can help.  It takes any file changes and logs them under compartmentalized modifications that it labels as <b>Commits</b>.  Every <b>Commit</b> saves the time and date it is made, and the specialized message the user assigns to it.  For an example of this, Check the second <b>commit</b> on this <b>repository</b>.
