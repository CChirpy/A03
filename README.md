Assignment 3 in my web development class, should just be a readme file explaining Git.

Today we are going to talk version control on <b>GitHub</b>.  We will go over <b>Git</b>, <b>GitHub</b>, and how to set up your IDE (In this case, JetBrains Webstorm) to use version control via <b>Git</b>.

Lets go over <b>Git</b>.

<b>Git</b> is an open source project that is made for version control.  What is version control?  Simply put, if I make a change on one device, all the other devices get an update.  For instance, I'm working on the code for a brand new website.  I would like to keep my work documented and backed up.  This is how <b>Git</b> can help.  It takes any file changes and logs them under compartmentalized modifications that it labels as <b>Commits</b>.  Every <b>Commit</b> saves the time and date it is made, and the specialized message the user assigns to it.  For an example of this, Check the second <b>commit</b> on this <b>repository</b>.  As you can see it shows that I made the introduction to <b>git</b>.  <b>Git</b> can also be used as a way to collaborate.  If me and my friend want to work on the same bit of code, I only need to give that friend access to the <b>repository</b>.  But where are these <b>repositories</b> hosted?  This is where <b>GitHub</b> comes in.

What is <b>Github</b>?

<b>Github</b> is a <b>Git</b> hosting service which is currently run and maintained by Microsoft.  What makes it special?  Other than keeping all of your code and work safe and secure on a completely free hosting service, there is also in depth version control.  Using the power of <b>Git</b> you can see every little change shown on a clean web UI.  Every <b>push</b>, every <b>pull</b>, every <b>merge</b>, and every <b>clone</b> that is made on a <b>repository</b> is logged and documented.  It allows for a clean work flow and an extremely versatile update delivery service.  But how do we use <b>Git</b>?
